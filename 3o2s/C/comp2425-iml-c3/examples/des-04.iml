// load images from a given path (input)
image i is load from read "Path: "
image k is run from read "Path: "

// morphological gradient: dilate minus erode
// extract the edges of one object
image d is i dilate by k 
image e is i erode by k
image r is d .- e

// crude perimeter estimation
number p is count pixel 1.0 in r
output "The perimeter is: " + string(p)

// store the edges image
r store into "images/edges.pgm"
