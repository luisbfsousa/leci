% Random walk on the Markov chain
% Inputs:
% H - state transition matrix
% first - initial state
% last - terminal or absorving state
function [state] = crawl(H, first, last)
% the sequence of states will be saved in the vector "state"
% initially, the vector contains only the initial state:
    state = [first];
% keep moving from state to state until state "last" is reached:
    while (1)
    state(end+1) = nextState(H, state(end));
        if ismember(state(end), last) % verifies if state(end) is absorbing
            break;
        end
    end
end
% Returning the next state
% Inputs:
% H - state transition matrix
% currentState - current state
function state = nextState(H, currentState)
% find the probabilities of reaching all states starting at the current one:
    probVector = H(:,currentState)'; % probVector is a row vector
    n = length(probVector); %n is the number of states
% generate the next state randomly according to probabilities probVector:
    state = discrete_rnd(1:n, probVector);
end
% Generate randomly the next state.
% Inputs:
% states = vector with state values
% probVector = probability vector
function state = discrete_rnd(states, probVector)
    U=rand();
    i = 1 + sum(U > cumsum(probVector));
    state= states(i);
